                <p><strong>How to access the unit...</strong><br/>
                    The unit can be accessed from any of the entrances within the hospital however it is easier to enter at the maternity entrance on the Kilton Hill side.  However, after 21:30 the unit can only be accessed via A+E as all other entrances are locked.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest car park...</strong><br/>
                    The nearest car park is outside the maternity entrance at the Kilton Hill side of the hospital where there are some free parking spaces and some pay and display spaces. Otherwise there is ample parking around the hospital site.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Car parking charges...</strong><br/>
                    There are numerous free car parks around the hospital site with limited parking (which are all signposted) plus a few car parks that are pay and display (up to around £4 for a days’ parking). We also offer concessionary car parking to parents with a baby on the unit. This roughly equates to a week’s parking for the cost of a day’s parking.  A form must be completed to receive this which is found within your baby admission pack.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest bus stop...</strong><br/>
                    There is a bus stop outside the maternity entrance with regular buses into Worksop town centre. The bus also stops at Morrison’s supermarket.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest railway station...</strong><br/>
                    Worksop train station is one mile from the hospital.

            <div id="tab2" class="tabContent visiting">
                <h3 class="first">Visiting Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents...</strong><br>
                    We have open visiting for parents 24 hours a day. While visiting, we ask parents and visitors to respect other families’ privacy and not look at or comment on babies other than their own. This request has been included at the suggestion of other parents, who have spent time in the Neonatal or Special Care Baby Units.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors...</strong><br>
					Noise can adversely affect pre-term infants.  For this reason, we ask that only two visitors per baby are present at any one time, in addition to the parents.  If we are busy, we may have to reduce this number.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings...</strong><br>
                    Brothers and sisters are welcome to visit.  We have a family sitting room with a small selection of toys and videos.  While children are in a play area, they are the responsibility of their parents.<br/>
                    Siblings are also welcome to stay in the parents rooms with parents and we have small airbeds to accommodate them if they wish to stay.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Grandparents...</strong><br>
                    Grandparents have open visiting. They can visit without parents being present if the parents have given permission or completed a visiting sheet, otherwise we ask that they do not visit unless they are accompanied by a parent as they will be refused access.
                </p>
				<p><strong>Family and friends...</strong><br>
                    Anyone can visit up until 8pm but we do have a quiet hour between 3-4pm and we request that only parents and grandparents visit during this period.  Anyone can visit without parents being present if the parents have given permission or completed a visiting sheet, otherwise we ask that they do not visit unless they are accompanied by a parent as they will be refused access.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restrictions...</strong><br>
                    For security reasons, visitors will only be allowed in the unit when a parent is present, or by prior arrangement with parents and staff.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To limit the risk of bringing childhood infections into the unit, we ask that children under 14 years, who are not brothers or sisters, do not visit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pre-term infants need a great deal of rest.  Over handling can adversely affect their growth and we therefore have a ‘minimal handling’ philosophy.  As a guide, we ask that only parents touch their babies while they are nursed in an incubator and other family members save their cuddles until baby is nursed in a cot (after asking for parent’s permission).  Too much handling can affect your baby’s growth so we may ask you to limit the frequency of cuddles and amount of time you touch your baby, especially if his or her condition is unstable.  Please discuss this with the nurse caring for your baby
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention...</strong><br>
                    Newborn infants who are ill or premature are extremely susceptible to infection which can be life threatening. Therefore if any member of your family and friends become ill, please ask them not to visit.  If you are ill, please speak to the nurse caring for your baby as it may be appropriate for you not to visit for a few days.   If you have a fever, sneezing, diarrhoea, runny nose, cough or vomiting please stay away until you are at least 48 hours symptom free.  A cleansing hand gel is provided on the unit for you to use however, you are still required to wash your hands before handling your baby.  Hands must be washed on entry to the nursery and re-entry if you have left the unit and returned.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Babies are routinely screened for infection when they are admitted to the unit, and once a week after this for the duration of their stay. If you wish to discuss this in more detail, please speak to the member of staff caring for your baby.
                </p>

            <div id="tab3" class="tabContent ward">
                <h3 class="first">Ward Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Mobile phone use...</strong><br>
                    There are no restrictions to mobile phones being switched on however, we do ask that you do not make or receive phone calls in the nursery and we ask that you keep ringtones to minimal. This is to allow the babies to sleep without being unnecessarily disturbed.
                </p>
                <p>
					The staff will photograph your baby on admission to the unit to allow mothers and families to have a print of their child with them throughout their stay and remains the property of the mother.  The pictures are essentially “instant prints” (like Polaroid print) and digital copies are not stored.  If you want to photograph your baby on your mobile phone or camera it is important that:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You only photograph your own baby and family</li>
                    <li>You respect the privacy and dignity of other babies, staff and visitors by ensuring that you do not get them in your pictures</li>
                    <li>You do not photograph the names of other babies or any medical notes or other information on the unit</li>
                    <li>You do not shoot any video on the unit, as private conversations relating to the treatment of other babies may be recorded at the same time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Although you may take pictures of your child on your mobile phone, please do not send these pictures to any social networking sites until you are outside of the nursery, as this may interfere with medical equipment
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent facilities...</strong><br>
                    We have kitchen facilities on the unit for parents to use and tea, coffee and milk are provided free of charge. Breakfast, lunch and supper are also provided for resident mums and vouchers are available for their partners use in our dining rooms which allows them to purchase a meal at staff prices.  Vouchers can be obtained from the staff on the special care baby unit.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent accommodation...</strong><br>
                    We have on-site facilities for parents to stay which include one double room and one single room (which can have a fold-up bed so both parents can stay if needed).  Priority is given to parents whose baby needs to establish breast feeding before going home.  Unfortunately, if you are resident, you may be asked to give up your room if there is another family with more urgent needs and we hope you will understand if this affects you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you wish to leave the hospital premises when resident, please let a member of staff know in case there is an emergency which requires evacuated of the unit
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding facilities and support...</strong><br>
                    We have a number of breast pumps for mums on the unit to express and we provide all of the necessary equipment and facilities (including rooms and privacy screens) to do this.  We also provide an electric pump which mum can take home and use while their baby is still an in-patient - although this has to be returned before baby is discharged.  All of our nursing staff are trained to provide breastfeeding support and we can also access the services of the Specialist Infant Feeding Midwife. We also have screens and rooms to allow the mums to express in private.
                </p>

                    The neonatal unit at Doncaster Royal Infirmary holds monthly support group meetings for parents of babies who are currently on the unit at Doncaster and at Bassetlaw or who have previously been cared for up to the age of two years. All parents are invited to come along to have a drink and a chat with staff and other parents and details of dates and venues are displayed on the unit.  We also have a Bliss volunteer (Georgia) who is on the unit every Wednesday.
                </p>
