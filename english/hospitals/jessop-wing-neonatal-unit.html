                	NICU is on level 2 of the Jessop Wing and is signposted from the lift area. Access is via the main doors and you will need to press the buzzer to gain access.  Please bear with us as, at times, the staff are caring for a baby and cannot answer immediately.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest car park...</strong><br/>

                <p><strong>Car parking charges...</strong><br/>
                    All parents who have a baby on the neonatal unit are entitled to free parking in the Jessop Wing car park providing they display a permit in the windscreen of their car.  Ask staff for a permit but please note, this permit does not guarantee a parking space.  Other visitors will have to pay for parking in either the Jessop Wing (open 24 hours) or Hallamshire Hospital (open weekdays 06:30-22:30) so please bring plenty of change.  Parking charges are currently £2.50 up to 2 hours, £3.70 up to 4 hours and £8.40 over 4 hours. Meter parking on roads around the Jessop Wing is available for up to 4 hours

                <h3 class="first">Visiting Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents...</strong><br>
					Parents are encouraged to visit at any time.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors...</strong><br>
					We ask that a maximum of two people are by the cot side at any one time because space is limited in the unit.  Other visitors can use the neonatal waiting rooms and ‘take turns’ to visit your baby.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings...</strong><br>
					Brothers and sisters of your baby can visit at any time, provided they are accompanied by a relative.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Grandparents...</strong><br>
                    Grandparents can visit at any time.
                </p>
				<p><strong>Family and friends...</strong><br>
                    If you would like any of your family and friends to visit without you being present, please tell the nurse caring for your baby and a record will be made of this request.  Without this record, your visitors will only be able to visit if you are present.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restrictions...</strong><br>
                    While we welcome visitors, we do ask that children under the age of 14 years who are not brother or sister of the baby do not come to the unit due to the risk of infection.  Please also see the section below on ‘Hygiene and Infection Prevention’.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention...</strong><br>
                    All visitors to the neonatal unit are asked to help us reduce the risk of infection by using the alcohol hand rub when entering and leaving the neonatal unit and also when entering the nursery your baby is in.  <br>
					On arrival we ask that coats are hung on the pegs inside the neonatal unit, and bags/valuables stored in the secure lockers at the entrance to the unit.<br>
					Before touching your baby we ask that you wash your hands and ensure all jewellery from hands and wrists is removed.  This can also be stored in the lockers.<br>
					If you or one of your visitors are unwell with tummy upset, cold sores, sore throat, coughs, colds or have been in contact with chicken pox, please call the unit to see if it is safe for them or you (if you have had contact) to visit.
                </p>

Separate shower rooms are located on the parent corridor, as is a parent kitchen which has a microwave, kettle, fridge and freezer. Cereals, milk, tea and coffee are provided for breakfast. Very occasionally we are unable to provide onsite accommodation for parents wishing to be resident. On these occasions we may be able to offer accommodation near the Hallamshire Hospital for a minimal charge. If this charge proves difficult for you The Chaplaincy Charitable Trust, The Sunday Fund, may be able to assist you.
