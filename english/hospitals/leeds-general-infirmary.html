                <h3 class="first">Visiting Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents...</strong><br>
                  Parents are welcome and encouraged to be with their baby and can therefore visit the unit anytime
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors...</strong><br>
                  Because we want to keep the noise and infection risk to a minimum for our babies we allow a maximum of two adults and siblings at the bedside at any one time
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings...</strong><br>
                  Brothers and sisters are welcome to visit between 08.00-19:00.  We would ask that if they have a cold, upset tummy or other illness that they do not visit
                </p>
                <p><strong>Grandparents...</strong><br>
                  Grandparents can visit between 12:00 to 19:00
                </p>
                 <p><strong>Family and friends...</strong><br>
                   Family and friends can visit between 12:00 to 19:00
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restrictions...</strong><br>
                    Children under the age of 16 years are not admitted routinely unless they are the baby’s siblings.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention...</strong><br>
                    The babies on our unit and small and sick and very vulnerable to infections.  Bugs that would not affect a healthy baby can be devastating to a premature or sick infant. We therefore take hand washing and hand hygiene very seriously.  If you observe that someone’s hand hygiene is not as good as you would expect, please do challenge them.
                    <br/>
                    All visitors should wash hands and use sanitising gel on entry to the unit.
                    <br/>
                    Lockers are available for outside coats and bags to be stored safely.  Hands must be washed each time you enter the clinical area, and must be cleaned with sanitising gel before touching your baby.  The nurse looking after your baby will show you the correct hand hygiene technique for washing and the use of the gel.  Parents are asked to take responsibility for showing all other visitors the correct hand hygiene technique.
                    <br/>
If you or your visitors have had any illness, diarrhoea or vomiting in the days before visiting please speak to the nurse in charge before entering the clinical area.
                </p>
            </div><!-- tab2 -->
            <div id="tab3" class="tabContent ward">
                <h3 class="first">Ward Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Mobile phone use...</strong><br>
                    Mobile phones can be used to text and take photographs however we ask that parents have their phones on silent and do not make or receive calls in the clinical areas.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent facilities...</strong><br>
                    There are facilities on the ward to make tea and coffee (which is free of charge) and the use of a microwave.  A cold drinks machine is available in the parents’ sitting room and there are also some toys for siblings to play with however, we are unable to provide any childcare.  There is a fridge by the ward kitchen area for parents to store food and there are also lockers in the parent’s sitting room to store outdoor clothing, bags etc. The lockers requires a £1 coin on a return system.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent accommodation...</strong><br>
                    There are two bedrooms on the unit used for the parents of very sick babies or for rooming in when preparing for discharge.  Eckersley House, which is opposite the Clarendon Wing, is available for families from outside Leeds.  Priority for these rooms is given to parents of patients on the neonatal unit and parents of children in intensive care and a room may not be available straight away so, at busy times, the hospital operates a waiting list.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding facilities and support...</strong><br>
                    There are two expressing rooms are available and we can loan you a breast pump or, if you are from outside of Leeds, we may ask your local unit to loan you one.  Please ask the nurse looking after your baby or your midwife for help and support with expressing.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Facilities for siblings...</strong><br>
                    We are hoping to provide some volunteers to play with siblings during the evening (and possibly at weekends) in order to enable parents to be free to spend time with their baby.  However this is not available at the present time and we ask that parents do not leave their other children alone in the sitting room.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent support group...</strong><br>
                    Having a baby on the neonatal unit can be extremely stressful, and sometimes you may feel that you need support.  Bliss, the premature baby charity, provides parent volunteers that can come and talk to you during your baby’s stay in hospital.  Many parents find this really helpful and all the volunteers have experience of being parents on the neonatal unit themselves.  Sometimes you need a little bit more than this and a counsellor is also available.  There are occasional coffee mornings for resident parents and Bliss have many support groups around Leeds and Yorkshire to support you when you go home.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Religious and spiritual support...</strong><br>
                    Most religious denominations are catered for and there is a chapel and prayer room available within the hospital.  There are hospital chaplains for most faiths on call who are happy to attend when families would like to see them – just ask the nurse caring for your baby and they can organise this for you.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Play specialists...</strong><br>
                    Play specialists are not available at LGI at the moment but we have plans to provide this service in the future to support your baby and their siblings when visiting.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Telephone and computer access...</strong><br>
                    You may use your mobile phone to make calls outside the clinical areas and we have an iPad which can be used to Skype or FaceTime family members if they are unable to visit.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Bereavement support...</strong><br>
                    If, sadly, it is thought that your baby is not going to survive, you will be supported at all times by a member of both the nursing and medical staff.  You will be allowed to spend as much time with your baby as you would like and visiting restrictions are usually lifted.  Counselling services are available and we will provide you with all the information you need at the time, including bereavement support which you can access.  You will also be invited back to the unit to talk to your baby’s consultant approximately six weeks after your baby passes away.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Counselling...</strong><br>
                    A limited counselling service is available from our unit counsellor on Mondays and Tuesdays.  At other times if there is an urgent need for counselling/psychological support we can access the on call psychologist  - please speak to the nurse who is looking after your baby.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Other important stuff...</strong><br>
                    Kangaroo care (skin to skin contact) is promoted on the unit and whenever possible we will encourage mum and dad to have skin to skin contact with their baby.  We also promote positive touch techniques to help your baby remain calm and settled and the nurses will show you these techniques.  We also promote family integrated care and you will be encouraged to become involved in caring for your baby as their condition allows.  Again, the nurses will help and support you with this.
                </p>

                    Between 14:00 to 15:00 we try, wherever possible, to have a quiet time for the babies.  During this time we will dim the lights, avoid carrying out any procedures and aim to keep the clinical areas as quiet as possible.

If you wish to stay in the room with your baby while the other babies are being discussed, we ask that you wear headphones (which we can provide or you can use your own) in order to maintain patient confidentiality.

                <h3 class="first">Hospital Services</h3>
                <p><strong>Catering/refreshment facilities...</strong><br>
                    The main hospital dining room is opposite the baby unit in Clarendon Wing and breastfeeding mums are entitled to one free meal per day (the nurse looking after your baby will sort this out for you).  The small kitchen area on the unit has free tea and coffee making facilities together with a microwave and there is a cold drinks machine in the parents’ sitting room.  There is also a cold water dispenser on the unit.
                    <br/>
There are Costa Coffee outlets in Jubilee Wing and Clarendon Wing and a Tesco Express just outside the hospital grounds.  There are also a variety of shops and restaurants in the city centre which is a short walk away.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Other shops on site/nearby...</strong><br>
                    There are two small general shops which sell snacks, drinks, magazines and basic toiletries in Clarendon Wing and Jubilee Wing.  There is also a Tesco Express opposite Jubilee Wing and A&E which sells everything you would expect.  In addition, the LGI is located in the centre of Leeds so there is easy access to city centre shops and services.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Cashpoint machine</strong><br>
                    There is a cashpoint in the hospital on the ground floor at the main entrance to Jubilee Wing.  There is another one outside the main entrance at the Tesco Express opposite Jubilee Wing.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Access to a midwife...</strong><br>
                    Midwives care for resident mothers but if you have been discharged from hospital urgent access to a midwife will be provided. This will be organised by your nurse if you ask her.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Interpreting services...</strong><br>
                    Interpreters are available wherever needed if English is not the family’s first language.  Usually an interpreter will be able to come to meet the family and medical staff on the unit and the nurse caring for your baby can organise this if you ask.  If this is not possible we can use Language Line, which is a telephone translating service.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Laundry facilities...</strong><br>
                    There are no laundry facilities on the unit.  If you are living at home you are asked to take you r baby’s clothes home to be washed and, if you are staying in the parents accommodation at Eckersley House, a washing machine is available there.
