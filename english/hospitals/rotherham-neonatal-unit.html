                <p>
                    On rare occasions, visitors may be asked to wait in the sitting room if staff are dealing with an emergency – if this involves your baby we will keep you updated on the situation.

                <h3 class="first">Visiting Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents...</strong><br>
                    Parents can visit at any time day or night.  We try to reserve evening visiting times after 20:00 for parents to have some quieter time with their baby.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors...</strong><br>
                   We do not restrict the visitor numbers but, if the nursery is becoming very crowded and it is affecting our ability to care for the baby, we will ask some visitors to wait in the visitor’s sitting room. Priority is always given parents.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings...</strong><br>
                    Brothers and sisters of the baby can visit at any time but must be accompanied by an adult.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Grandparents...</strong><br>
                    Grandparents are allowed to visit at any time provided parents have given their consent for them to visit if a parent is not there.  Please speak to a member of the nursing team.
                </p>
                 <p><strong>Family and friends...</strong><br>
                    Parents are asked to give their consent for friends and other family members to visit when they are not there.  Please speak to a member of the nursing team.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Restrictions...</strong><br>
                    Other visitors can visit at any time provided they have the permission of the parents. We encourage other visitors to visit at the same time as parents wherever possible.  Parents are asked to inform the nursing staff if other visitors are expected. Children under the age of 16 (other than siblings) are not allowed to visit.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention...</strong><br>
                    All visitors are asked to use the Hand Gel as they enter the unit and wash their hands using soap and water before touching the baby and after changing nappies.  Visitors must not touch any baby other than their own.  Any visitors who are unwell or who have signs of infection must not visit - please inform the Nurse in Charge and she will confirm whether or not it is safe for the affected person to visit. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Parents are asked to provide basic hygiene equipment for the baby (e.g. nappies) and we do not recommend the use of baby wipes for nappy care.
                </p>

            <div id="tab3" class="tabContent ward">
                <h3 class="first">Ward Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Mobile phone use...</strong><br>
                    It is important that telephone calls are made either in the entrance to the unit or in the public areas of the hospital as this helps to reduce noise levels which babies can find stressful.  Mobile phones can be used to take photographs of your baby.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent facilities...</strong><br>
                    The parent’s kitchen has a fridge, a microwave and a kettle. Parents can use these to store and reheat their own food and free tea and coffee is supplied for all parents.  When using the fridge, please label any food you’re your name and the date. Parents and visitors are also expected to wash all crockery after use to ensure that clean supplies are available for the next parent.  To prevent injury to baby hot drinks must not be consumed at the cot side.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Mothers who have not been discharged from maternity care will also receive meals. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent accommodation...</strong><br>
                    We have three parent rooms (which can accommodate both parents) and these include a shared bathroom, a sitting room and a kitchen.  Parents are usually invited to stay overnight with their baby before discharge home. If your baby is very unwell you may also be asked if you want to stay to be closer during a critical time. 
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding facilities and support...</strong><br>
                    The nursing staff will support mothers to breast feed, establish feeding and to express breast milk .  To aid this, breast pumps (for use at the cot side or in the expressing room) are available. There is a limited supply of pumps   available for loan to use at home.  It is important that breast pumps are returned promptly when the baby is discharged or the pump is on longer needed.  Additional support and advice for breastfeeding is also available from the infant feeding coordinator.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you chose to bottle-feed your baby, the nursing staff will show you how to sterilize equipment and make up feeds safely. We recommend that you bring in the bottles your baby will use at home so baby can get used to these before they go home.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Facilities for siblings...</strong><br>
                    Siblings are very welcome on the unit but must be supervised at all times by a parent or a responsible adult.  There are toys available for their use in a toy box near the nurseries and in the sitting room.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent support group...</strong><br>
                    The unit has a Bliss parent support volunteer who visits the unit every Monday afternoon. She has personal experience of being the parent of a pre-term baby who was admitted to the neonatal unit.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Religious and spiritual support...</strong><br>
                    There is a chapel and prayer room located on C level with spiritual support available  for all major religions and denominations – please speak to a member of staff. Families can also contact their own religious leaders for support if they wish.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Play specialists...</strong><br>
                    The unit does not have play specialists but does have a small team of nursery nurses who will work with parents to prepare them for the discharge of their baby. They can advise on feeding, weaning, general baby care safe sleeping and car safety. They can also refer the family to Children’s Centres and other support.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Telephone and computer access...</strong><br>
                    The unit doses not have access to pay phone facilities, but mobile phones can be used in designated areas.  Personal laptops and tablets can be used on the unit but the Trust’s WiFi cannot be accessed.  Any piece of electrical equipment which is plugged into the mains must be checked for electrical safety.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Bereavement support...</strong><br>
                    In the event of a baby dying the Patient Experience Team will provide support to families and the bereavement centre will help with registering the death and the practicalities of funeral arrangements.  Parents are also supported by a bereavement midwife who specialises in the care of families following the loss of a baby.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Counselling...</strong><br>
                    Counselling for parents can be arranged by either the midwifery services or the baby’s consultant when required.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Other important stuff...</strong><br>
                    We will only give information about a baby’s condition to the parents of that baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The hospital has nursing and medical students in training placements and a student under the supervision of a qualified nurse or doctor may care for your baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some babies have more complex needs and, to ensure you are well supported after discharge, it may be necessary to hold a discharge planning meeting with yourself and staff who will be caring for your baby in the community.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When your baby is ready to be discharged you will be offered the opportunity to complete the Friends and Family questionnaire. This is an opportunity for you to feedback on our service, help us to improve and it is completely anonymous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have any concerns about your baby after discharge you can telephone the unit for advise
                </p>

                <p><strong>Family centred care/developmental care lead...</strong><br>
                    The unit provides holistic care specific to the needs of each baby and their family and every effort will be made to involve parents in decisions about the care of their baby. The nursing staff will help you to co-ordinate your visiting with the baby’s feed and care times.  The nursing staff will  help parents to understand the changing developmental needs of their baby as they grow and will help you to care for your baby in a way that encourages them to reach their milestones.

                <p><strong>Baby rest time...</strong><br>
                    Quiet times and rest are important to help your baby to develop a healthy sleep pattern. We therefore try to have periods in the day when the unit is kept as quiet as possible. We may also dim the lights in the nursery to encourage rest. You may find it useful to take advantage of quiet time when you are visiting to sit and relax.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Who to talk to about your baby’s care...</strong><br>

                <p><strong>Laundry facilities...</strong><br>
                    Any clothes provided by the hospital are washed on the unit but baby’s own clothes are placed in a laundry bag to be taken home to be washed.  Occasionally personal items may get into the unit laundry and, if you think this has happened, please speak to a member of the nursing staff.
