                <p><strong>How to access the unit...</strong><br/>
                    Sheffield Children’s Hospital is built on numerous levels and to access Neonatal Surgical Unit (NSU) is via Emergency Department (ED).  Walk through the double doors and either walk down the stairs in front of you or take a lift down to B- level.  Follow the corridor right round theatres then take a lift to C floor.  On leaving the lift, turn right and buzz for NSU (we are part of Paediatric Critical Care).
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest car park...</strong><br/>
                    The Children’s Hospital currently does not have a designated car park although one is under construction and, once built, there will have spaces for parents.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest bus stop...</strong><br/>
                    The 52 bus stops outside ED (Hillsborough terminal to Woodhouse via city centre) the other way.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Nearest railway station...</strong><br/>
                    The nearest railway station is Sheffield Midland Station then take the tram to the Children’s Hospital (exit tram at the University stop).
