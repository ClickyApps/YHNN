                <h3 class="first">How to access the unit...</h3>
                <p>
                    The neonatal unit is located on level 5 of the Gledhow Wing and this can be accessed via a lift (or by stairs) from the main reception area.  There is a secure telephone camera entrance system and visitors are asked to ring the bell to gain admission

                <p>
                    Parents are offered a parking permit for the duration of their stay in the neonatal unit, this is on site this is located in the multi story car park close to Bexley Wing, there are directions within the grounds. There are numerous other pay and display car parks around the hospital site and visitors can use the multi-story car park on site. The car parks off site are run by Leeds City Council and prices start at £2 and increase in hourly intervals. The on-site car park charges start at £2.50 to a maximum of £16 per day.
                </p>

                    Parking charges vary from £2.50 per day to £16 per day. The car park at the back of the hospital on Dolly Lane is the cheapest but this involves a significant walk.

                <h3 class="first">Visiting Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Parents...</strong><br>
                    Parents are allowed to visit their baby at any time.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Number of visitors...</strong><br>
                	We have to limit the number of visitors to two people per bed space but we do allow some flexibility under certain circumstances.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Siblings...</strong><br>
                    Siblings (baby’s brothers and sisters) are allowed to visit between the hours of 15:00-19:00.  This is extended to 12:00–19:00 during school holidays.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Grandparents...</strong><br>
                    Baby’s grandparents are allowed to visit between the hours of 15:00-19:00.
                </p>
                 <p><strong>Family and friends...</strong><br>
                    Other family members and friends are allowed to visit between the hours of 15:00-19:00 if accompanied by one of the parents.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Hygiene and infection prevention...</strong><br>
                    Families are taught clinical hand washing using soap and gel which should be practised on entering the unit and before and after each contact with their baby.
                </p>

            <div id="tab3" class="tabContent ward">
                <h3 class="first">Ward Information</h3>
                <p><strong>Mobile phone use...</strong><br>
                    Parents and visitors are requested to take calls away from the clinical bays.  If you are unsure, a member of staff will be able to advice you of where would be appropriate for you to take the call.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent facilities...</strong><br>
                    We have three rooms which can be used as bedrooms, a parent’s waiting areas and two kitchen areas which are located on the unit close to the entrance.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent accommodation...</strong><br>
                    We have three designated parent rooms.  Two are multi-function rooms which offer communal and private spaces and can be used for private conversations, rooming in, breast feeding and expressing of milk.  One of these rooms has en suite facilities but there is also a shower and a separate toilet on the ward for families and visitors to use.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Breastfeeding facilities and support...</strong><br>
                    All staff on the neonatal unit are trained to provide support for breastfeeding and some have received additional training.  We also have links with the midwives on the wards to provide additional support for mums when, in certain situations, early expression (before baby is born) is recommended  i.e. diabetic mums are actively encouraged to start expressing from 36 weeks to produce a stock of milk for use immediately after birth.  This reduces the need for intravenous fluids and formula milk.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Facilities for siblings...</strong><br>
                    We have a limited number of toys available for siblings to play with together with drawing packs and a small library of children’s books.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Parent support group...</strong><br>
                    Bliss support is available on the ward weekly these are ex parents who have had preterm infants they are a source of support and advice for families with babies currently on the unit.  Families are encouraged to join forums, face book etc for an alternative source of support.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Religious and spiritual support...</strong><br>
                    All religions are supported in Leeds Teaching Hospital Trust.  There are prayer rooms available and an onsite chapel in the grounds of St James close to the Gledhow Wing.  There are also prayer facilities in the Bexley Wing of St James.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Play specialists...</strong><br>
                    There are no play specialists at St James Hospital.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Telephone and computer access...</strong><br>
                    We will soon have a tablet which can be used by parents to Skype or face time, BadgerNet family diary is also soon to be available for families.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Bereavement support...</strong><br>
                    We do not have any designated professional support at St James’s Hospitals but we do have a bereavement office on level 4 of the Gledhow Wing which provides advice and guidance.  The neonatal unit also offers bereavement boxes and a variety of information leaflets.
                    <br/>All bereaved families are offered an appointment with a consultant neonatologist one month after their baby’s death and we can also arrange a meeting with the obstetric team if this is required.  Further meetings can be arranged according to the family’s needs and counselling sessions (in respect of future pregnancies) can be arranged.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Counselling...</strong><br>
                    Counselling can be arranged according to individual needs.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Other important stuff...</strong><br>
                    Our neonatal unit is part of a regional service and we therefore have access to a full multidisciplinary team although some services are not on available on site.  We have dedicated time from speech and language therapists, dietitians, occupation therapists and physiotherapists – all on a weekly basis.
                    <br/>St James Hospital is predominantly a high-to-low dependency unit with two short term ventilation cots.  There are plans to centralise neonatal services in Leeds but no date for these changes is known at present.
                </p>
