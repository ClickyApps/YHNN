	    	<p>If you are planning to feed your baby by bottle,  once your baby starts showing signs that they are ready to take some of their feed themselves there are some things you can do to help them.  Give your baby eye contact during feeds and they may look back at you.  It is also important that you watch your baby so you can tell when they are getting tired and have had enough.  You can also have skin to skin while you are bottle feeding, and this will help you and your partner build a close and loving relationship with your baby.</p>
	    	<p>When a baby feeds they have to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing which is a skill that takes time for premature babies to develop.  Different teats might help with this and staff will help you to choose the best one for your baby.  They will also help you to recognise when baby is ready to move on.</p>
	    	<p>When your baby is feeding it is important that you hold them in a way that gives you both as much support as possible so that your baby can concentrate on learning the new skill of feeding and you are comfortable and can watch your baby.  Staff will help you find the right position for you and your baby and they will also support you to learn about sterilising feeding equipment and preparing formula feeds.</p>
