	    	<p>When a baby feeds they have to coordinate sucking, swallowing and breathing, when babies are born prematurely, this skill takes time to develop. As your baby’s feeding skills develop they will start to try and latch onto your breast and begin sucking. Premature babies tire easily so this will be a gradual progress and every baby is different.</p>
	    	<p>You may notice that during skin to skin your baby starts to lick or nuzzle your skin or try to move towards your breast  so staff will help support you to position your baby at your breast.  Your baby may not attach to your breast or suck to begin with, but they will enjoy being close and the smell of your milk.  This is a good time to practice holding you baby and positioning your baby at the breast and finding a position that is comfortable for you both.</p>
	    	<p>Your baby will still be having milk feeds through their feeding tube to continue to support their growth, and as your baby feeds more from the breast they will need less tube feeds.  Staff will help you manage your expressing during this time, and support you and your baby make the transition from tube feeding to breast feeding.  Good positioning and attachment are important for feeding to be effective and staff will help you to understand and recognise these signs, and to recognise your baby’s feeding cues and how to respond to them.</p>
	    	<p>Breast feeding is a skill that takes time and practice so spending as much time with your baby as you can and giving them as many opportunities to breast feed will help.</p>
