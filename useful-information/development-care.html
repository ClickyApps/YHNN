	    	<p>A family centred developmental approach has better outcomes for babies in neonatal care as it means less stress for babies, shorter hospital stays and better long terms outcomes.  Consideration is given to baby’s posture and sensory development as well as looking at their behaviour and trying to understand their cues.  It also looks at ways of developing the relationship between parents and their baby.  Many neonatal units now practise these principles and parents feel more involved in the care of their babies and relationships between hospital staff and parents are strengthened.</p>
	    	<p>However, premature babies make take longer than babies born at full term to reach the normal developmental milestones as they are, in fact, younger.  To determine their development progress babies will be assessed according to their ‘corrected age’ which is the age they are from the date they were due.  As your baby grows, they will be regularly assessed and monitored by healthcare professionals who could include support from a physiotherapist or occupational therapist.  This ongoing support should reassure you that your baby is doing well and if you have any concerns about your baby’s development, then you should discuss this with your healthcare professional.</p>
