	    	<p>When your baby is born, they may not be able to feed straight away so, while your baby is growing and getting stronger, you can pump milk from your breasts.  This is called “expressing” and to get your milk supply off to the best start it is recommended that you start within two hours (or as soon as possible) after your baby is born and staff will explain how to do this. The milk you express in the first few days is called Colostrum and it is thicker and more yellow than the milk produced later on.  It will only be produced in small amounts but every drop is important as it contains many beneficial properties including protecting your baby from infection.</p>
	    	<p>As you continue to express, the quantity of breast milk will increase and you can then combine hand expressing with using a hand or electric pump. Again, staff will show you what to do to ensure that expressing is comfortable and effective.  Staff will also explain to you how to store your milk both at home and on the neonatal unit.</p>
	    	<p>There are certain things you can do to help you to establish your milk supply and a few ideas are listed below:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Expressing regularly, around eight to ten times every 24 hours (including during the night) as this is the frequency your baby would feed.  Once your milk supply is established it may be possible to reduce the amount of expressing you do without it affecting your milk supply.</li>
	    		<li>Expressing next to your baby’s cot or incubator or looking at a photo or video of your baby, as this make you think about your baby.</li>
	    		<li>Having skin-to-skin contact or Kangaroo care with your baby. This can also help your body to make more antibodies which pass into your milk helping to protect your baby from infection.</li>
	    		<li>Doing some breast massage before and after expressing.</li>
	    		<li>Making sure you take care of yourself by eating and drinking regularly.</li>
	    		<li>Keeping a record of when you express and the amount of milk can encourage you to continue as you see the amounts increasing each day.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>Sometimes there may be a delay in your milk supply becoming established because of your shortened pregnancy, especially if your baby was born very prematurely, or if you have been unwell so, it may take a bit longer.</p>
