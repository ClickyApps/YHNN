	    	<p>Cleaning you baby’s mouth gives you an opportunity to get to know your baby and their way of responding to you.  It is carried out while baby is awake and uses sterile water, expressed breast milk and a cotton bud.  The cotton bud is dipped into the sterile water and gently rolled along baby’s lips, along the gum line and over their tongue.  Once their mouth is clean, the cotton bud is dipped into the expressed milk and wiped round their mouth again - they may even suck on the cotton bud.  Expressed breast milk gives baby something nice to taste and this method of mouth care should continue until baby is able to take feeds by mouth.</p>
	    	<p>Nappy changing is another way you can be involved in your baby’s care and is better done by two people as one keeps baby settled and comfortable while the other changes their nappy.  Keeping baby settled can be done by resting a cupped hand on their head and on their feet or by offering a finger to grasp or something to suck.  If you are changing the nappy on your own, wrap a blanket around baby’s arms and shoulders to help to keep them calm and, if your baby becomes active or uncomfortable during their nappy change, think about pausing for a while until they are relaxed again.</p>
	    	<p>Babies on the neonatal unit are often too small to have a bath but, once they are stable enough, you can gently clean their face with soft gauze pads and warm water.  When your baby is able to maintain their own temperature they will be able to have their first bath which is a very important event so have a camera ready so you can take lots of photographs.  As you put your baby into the bath speak to them as this will help to reassure them.  Small babies can find bathing a tiring experience and a technique called wrap bathing may be used.  This is where baby is wrapped in a sheet or muslin square, gradually placed into a warm bath and one part of the body is exposed, washed and then re-wrapped.   The nurses on the neonatal unit will support you throughout this time and will continue to do so until you feel comfortable bathing baby on your own.</p>
