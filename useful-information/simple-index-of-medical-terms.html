	    <div class="contentArea">
	    	<p><strong>Apnoea</strong></p>
	    	<p>When baby stops breathing for short periods of time.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Brain haemorrhage</strong></p>
	    	<p>Bleeding in the brain caused by tears in the blood vessels and classified according to the severity.  Grade 1 is mild, Grade 2 is moderate, Grade 3  and 4 are severe.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Cooling</strong></p>
	    	<p>Cooling is used for a specific condition where the brain needs to be cooled down to prevent brain damage.</p>
	    	<p><strong>CPAP</strong></p>
	    	<p>Continuous positive airway pressure - breathing support given through baby’s nose.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Extremely low birth weight</strong></p>
	    	<p>Birth weight less than 1000 grams (2lbs).</p>
	    	<p><strong>Extremely preterm</strong></p>
	    	<p>Less than 28 weeks in the womb.</p>
	    	<p><strong>HIE</strong></p>
	    	<p>Hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy - lack of oxygen and blood to the brain which is treated by cooling.</p>
	    	<p><strong>High frequency ventilation</strong></p>
	    	<p>Small amounts of air are blown into the lungs very rapidly and your baby’s chest will appear to vibrate.</p>
	    	<p><strong>IV</strong></p>
	    	<p>Intravenous - a fine tube (called a drip or cannula) inserted into a tiny blood vessel usually in a hand, foot, arm or leg.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Jaundice</strong></p>
	    	<p>A build-up of a chemical called bilirubin which often clears up on its own.  If levels are high, baby will be treated with phototherapy.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Low birth weight</strong></p>
	    	<p>Birth weight less than 2500 grams (5lbs).</p>
	    	<p><strong>Moderate to late preterm</strong></p>
	    	<p>32-37 weeks in the womb.</p>
	    	<p><strong>MRI</strong></p>
	    	<p>Magnetic resonance imaging.  A magnetic field is used to give pictures of internal organs and does not use radiation.  However, babies will be sedated before having an MRI to help them stay still.</p>
	    	<p><strong>NEC</strong></p>
	    	<p>Necrotising enterocolitis is when tissues in the intestine become inflamed and begin to die.  A hole may develop which allows the contents of the intestine to leak into the abdomen and treatment could include surgery.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Palliative care</strong></p>
	    	<p>This care is for babies and their families when the baby is recognised as having a life-threatening or life-limiting condition. It does not necessarily mean that your baby won’t survive.</p>
	    	<p><strong>PDA</strong></p>
	    	<p>Patent ductus arteriosus is a common heart condition in babies and is due to the delayed closure of a small blood vessel outside the heart.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Phototherapy</strong></p>
	    	<p>A treatment for jaundice where baby is placed naked under a blue light or on top of a light blanket.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Positive pressure ventilation</strong></p>
	    	<p>Oxygen-enriched air is gently blown into the lungs via a tube that is passed through the mouth or nose.  The rate of breathing will be regularly adjusted to meet your baby's needs.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Term</strong></p>
	    	<p>Born after at least 37 weeks in the womb.</p>
	    	<p><strong>TPN</strong></p>
	    	<p>Total parenteral nutrition is a mixture of nutrients delivered through a tube into baby’s arm or leg.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Ultrasound scan</strong></p>
	    	<p>Ultrasound waves are used to create a picture of what is happening inside the body. Ultrasound does not use radiation and you may be able to stay while this is being carried out.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Ventilator</strong></p>
	    	<p>Breathing support given through baby’s windpipe.</p>
	    	<p><strong>Very low birth weight</strong></p>
	    	<p>Birth weight less than 1500 grams (3lbs).</p>
	    	<p><strong>Very preterm</strong></p>
	    	<p>28-32 weeks in the womb.</p>
