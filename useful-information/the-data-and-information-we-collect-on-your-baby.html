	    <div class="contentArea">
	    	<p>When babies need the expert care provided on a neonatal unit it is important that information is collected on who is being looked after and what treatment they are receiving.</p>
	    	<h3>Why do we need this information?</h3>
	    	<p>The information collected helps to:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Collect accurate details about the care of sick or premature babies in units across the Yorkshire & Humber region.</li>
	    		<li>Monitor neonatal care and make sure that standards are adhered to.</li>
	    		<li>Plan and develop services for parents and their baby.</li>
	    		<li>Produce reports that highlight areas of good practice that can be shared across the region.</li>
	    		<li>Comply with national guidance and adhere to mandatory data collection.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>Any information that may be used in reports contains nothing that could identify either the mother or the baby.</p>
	    	<h3>What information is collected?</h3>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>The NHS number for both mother and baby.</li>
	    		<li>Patients postcode.</li>
	    		<li>Baby’s date of birth.</li>
	    		<li>Baby’s birthweight.</li>
	    		<li>How many weeks pregnant mother was when baby was born (gestational age).</li>
	    		<li>Baby’s condition and any treatment they received.</li>
	    		<li>Where baby was born.</li>
	    		<li>Any other hospitals where baby received treatment (if more than one).</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<h3>Who collects the information?</h3>
	    	<p>Staff working in the neonatal unit collect this information - usually this is a neonatal nurse, a doctor or a ward clerk.</p>
	    	<h3>When is this information collected?</h3>
	    	<p>Information is captured and recorded regularly throughout baby’s stay on the neonatal unit.</p>
	    	<h3>How is the information collected?</h3>
	    	<p>The information is recorded in an electronic system called BadgerNet and is a combined summary of both medical notes and nursing records.</p>
	    	<h3>Who will see the information?</h3>
	    	<p>Only the people who are actually caring for baby can see all of the details.  There are very strict regulations controlling access to personal information such as NHS numbers and dates of birth.  By law, everyone who works for the NHS must keep all personal information confidential.</p>
	    	<p>Clevermed (the organisation who own BadgerNet) has very strict confidentiality and security procedures in line with the Data Protection Act (1998).  They will make sure that information about your baby is not given to unauthorised people.</p>
