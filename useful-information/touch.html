	    	<p>Some babies are too sick to be taken out of their incubator but it is still possible for you to touch them by placing your hand through the porthole and cupping their head or their feet.  Stroking can be too stimulating for them at this stage as they need to rest.</p>
	    	<p>Once the doctors and nurses feel baby is ready, you may be encouraged to hold your baby ‘skin-to-skin’.  This is when you hold baby (who is just wearing a nappy) next to your bare chest and either one of the parents can hold baby in this way.  Skin-to-skin helps with bonding, attachment, parental anxiety and mother’s milk supply.  Skin-to-ski n is also good for baby as it promotes sleep and weight gain and it helps to regulate baby’s temperature, breathing and heart rate.  It also provides a positive sensory experience for baby as they get to smell and feel your skin.  When your baby is ready for skin-to-skin it may be useful if you wear loose clothing or a top that opens down the front as this will make it easier to position your baby.  You may also like to bring a hand held mirror so you can see your baby’s face during skin-to-skin.</p>
	    	<p>Kangaroo care involves holding your baby on your chest while dressed and it can last for as long as both you and your baby are comfortable.  At least an hour is beneficial as this gives you both time to relax and enjoy being together.  Some units use wraps, slings or stretchy bands like ‘boob tubes’ to help keep baby positioned with their back straight and their chin slightly tilted to help them breathe although you may prefer to bring your own shawl or blanket.</p>
	    	<p>Once baby is well enough, skin-to-skin or kangaroo care can be practised throughout the remainder on their stay on the neonatal unit and can be continued once discharged home.
