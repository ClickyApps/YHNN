	    	<p>When babies are born prematurely they may be unable to take enough milk to grow adequately, this might be for a number of reasons.  These include:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Baby has been born too early for the sucking reflex to be fully developed.</li>
	    		<li>Baby may be unable to take enough milk by breast or bottle as they tire easily.</li>
	    		<li>There may be a medical reason which makes feeding more difficult.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>In these situations milk can be given through a feeding tube and feeding in this was will help your baby receive enough nutrition to grow and develop.  There are two types of tube feeding used:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Nasogastric tube feeding - this is when a baby is fed through a small soft tube, which is placed in the nose and runs down the back of the throat, through the food pipe (oesophagus) and into the stomach.</li>
	    		<li>Orogastric tube feeding - this is when a baby is fed through a small soft tube, which is placed in the mouth and runs down the back of the throat, through the food pipe (oesophagus) and into the stomach.</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>There are many feeding experiences you can provide for your baby while they are having tube feeds including smelling milk during skin to skin, tasting milk during mouth care, practising sucking and tasting at the breast or the use of a dummy.  As your baby develops they will begin to show signs that they are ready to take some feeds themselves and staff will help you recognise these.  Signs may include waking at feed times, attempts  to suck or lick during skin to skin, mouthing their hands or rooting during tube feeds.</p>
