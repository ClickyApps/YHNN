	    	<p>Weaning is the introduction of solid foods and is an important stage in your baby’s development. Weaning your baby onto solids is a gradual process that can take time as all babies are different and some take longer than others.</p>
	    	<p>When milk can no longer provide all the nutrition your baby needs the introduction of solids will continue to support your baby’s growth.  Weaning also helps to support your baby’s development by giving them the opportunity to practice lip, tongue and jaw movements and experience a range of different tastes and textures so that their diet is well balanced.</p>
	    	<p>Most healthy preterm babies are ready to start weaning between five to eight months from the date they were born but, to ensure they have the necessary skills and head control needed, they also need to be at least three months corrected age.</p>
	    	<p>Signs that your baby may be ready to start weaning include:</p>
	    	<ul>
	    		<li>Can your baby be easily supported in a sitting position?</li>
	    		<li>Can your baby hold their head in a stable position?</li>
	    		<li>Is your baby showing interest in you and your family eating?</li>
	    		<li>Is your baby alert and looking ready to move on to a new type of feeding?</li>
	    		<li>Is breast or bottle feeding going well?</li>
	    		<li>Can your baby bring their hands to their mouth and are putting other things in their mouth?</li>
	    		<li>Are they making any “munching” movements with their mouth when putting things into their mouth?</li>
	    	</ul>
	    	<p>You can discuss whether or not your baby is ready for solid food  with your Health Visitor or other health care professional who may be supporting you at home.</p>
